# FXServer_Bat
Just a simple batch file for running FXServer

Instructions:
Place the batch file "z_run.bat" into your main fxserver folder.
run to exec the server.cfg via the batch file to initialize / Startup your fxserver.

(instead of having to mess around in cmd prompt doing cd/ \d ect.. everytime you want to start it up)
